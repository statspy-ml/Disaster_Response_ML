### Instructions:  <a name="instructions"></a>
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in the database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/

### Summary: <a name="summary"></a>
In this project, I've analyzed disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

The data set contains real messages that were sent during disaster events. I've created a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that messages can be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

This project has an app inside the app folder. Using it an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also display the visualization of the data.

### Dataset <a name="data"></a>
This disaster data is from [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/)
This dataset has two files messages.csv and categories.csv.
### Data Cleaning

1. Based on id two datasets were first merged into df.
2. Categories were split into separate category columns.
3. Category values were converted to numbers 0 or 1.
4. Replaced categories column in df with new category columns.
5. Removed duplicates based on the message column.
6. df were exported to etl.db database.

### Modeling Process <a name="model"></a>

1. Wrote a tokenization function to process text data.
2. Build a machine learning pipeline using TfidfVectorizer, RandomForestClassifier, and Pipeline.
3. Split the data into training and test sets.
4. Using pipeline trained and evaluated a simple RandomForestClassifier.
5. Then using hyperparameter tuning with 5 fold cross-validation fitted 100 models to find the best random forest model for predicting disaster response category. Random Forest best parameters were 
<code>
{'clf__criterion': 'entropy',
 'clf__max_depth': 40,
 'clf__max_features': 'auto',
 'clf__random_state': 42}
</code>

6. Using this best model we've made train_classifier.py

### Model results <a name="result"></a>

Our final RandomForestClassifier model with 5 fold cross-validation has the following results.

### Effect of Imbalance: <a name="effect"></a>
The dataset is an imbalance. We can get an idea of an imbalance from the following image.

For imbalanced classes with fewer samples, the model will not generalize well. For various categories, we should focus on recall as all the categories has the same precision.
